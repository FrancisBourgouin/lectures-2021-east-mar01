## What is AJAX

- Microsoft added a little-known function call named XMLHttpRequest to IE5
- Originated from Microst ActiveX, a component based software technology
- Took off after the publication [Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ajax%3A-A-new-approach-to-web-applications-Garrett/c440ae765ff19ddd3deda24a92ac39cef9570f1e) in 2005
- AJAX is a technique allowing the user interface to updates itself without reloading the whole web page.
- AJAX will communicate with the server, get data from the server, update the UI with the new data without reloading the whole web page.
- Before 2005, this could only be accomplished with Flash or Java Applets

## XMLHttpRequest

- In 2006 the W3 published a specification for the XMLHttpRequest object

- The XMLHttpRequest object is used to retrieve data from a server asynchronously.

- Initially, it was mainly using XML, but today it can use any other formats such as JSON.
