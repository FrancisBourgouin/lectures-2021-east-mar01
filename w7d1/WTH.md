# What was hard during weekend

- Attack of the new things (Webpack & Babel & JSX)
- Webpack & Babel
- Trust React (CRA)

Under the hoods things, made to compile & provide live servers, etc

- JSX

Templating language, like EJS <%=, but {}

- Props going down but not up wat
- Hooks magic (sufficiently advanced tech)
- React vague-ish
